Singing Sword | PULL SWORD | PULL the sword from the stone. | A beautiful silver sword has been wedged deep into a stone pedestal here. | A stone pedestal lies in the centre of the room, devoid of swords. | SKILL 10 | You struggle to pull the sword from the stone, but despite your best efforts, it doesn't budge. | You heave against the stone and pull the sword free from its grasp. You hear the sharp hum of the blade as it moves through the air - a job well-accomplished. | Courtyard

Shimmering Shield | SHINE SHIELD | SHINE an old shield until it shimmers. | An old, battered shield rests against the wall here. | There is nothing of note here. | SKILL 3 | You shine and buff the shield as much as you can, but you cannot seem to return it to its former glory. | The shield shines and shimmers like a mirror made of steel. You decide to take it with you. | Foyer

Trembling Tome | CALM TOME | CALM a trembling tome in the workshop. | A voluminous tome trembles violently in its bookshelf, threatening to bring the whole thing down on itself. | All is calm in this room. A battered, but well-stocked bookshelf keeps things together along the western wall. | WILL 5 | You reach forth to try calming the book, but the bookshelf just trembles harder! Did that book just snap at you with... teeth? | You reach out and stroke along the spine of the Trembling Tome. You hear the sound of ruffling pages, and the shuddering stops, allowing you to check out the book with no problems. | Workshop

Glistening Goblet | STEAL GOBLET | STEAL a glistening goblet from a distracted denizen. | A couple of fat cats are here, playing cards. They stop from time to time to drink from the glistening, ruby-encrusted goblets beside them, to varying degrees of success. | A couple of fat cats are here, engrossed in a game of cards. | SKILL 12 | You reach for the goblet, but one of the cats notices you and swats your hand away, hissing. | You distract one of the cats for a good while, just petting it. The fur is really soft, and they purr receptively to your touch - which is just as well, because that gives you the time to steal a Glistening Goblet from right under their noses. | Parlour
